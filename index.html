        <p id="about-me-text"><span>Traditional Printmaker turned Web Developer, I strive to be creative in everything I do.</span> I tried to make a go of being a practicing artist, but the more I devoted myself to thinking without limitations, the more I missed knowing what the right answer was, or even that there was one. Being both creative and logical, I was finding it hard to find the balance between these two sides of me. This is what turned me towards Web Development: knowing that my skills of composition theory (seeing a problem through to completion in the best, most efficient way) and logical problem solving would help me get into a field I would excel in. </p>
